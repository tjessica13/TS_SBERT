SBERT can be used for question answering and semantic search.

This experiment is testing if the retrieved songs match the keywords and meaning of the query.

Additionally, we test how SBERT handles song lyrics which have metaphors, improper sentence structures, and symbolism that may pose challenges for semantic search.
